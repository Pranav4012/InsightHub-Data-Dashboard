## DAY1 :-
         1> Set up the complete project structure
         2> Loaded and inspected the real student dataset
         3> Analyzed columns, data types, and missing values 
## DAY2 :- 
         1> Relationship between Attendance vs FinalScore
         2> Relationship between PracticeTime vs FinalScore
         3> Relationship between StudyHours vs FinalScore
         4> By the graph we analyze that the graph tends to upwards      
         5> Concluded that Attendance and PracticeTime have a strong influence on student performance
## DAY 3 :-
         1> Creates CareerReady based on FinalScore
         2> Separates features and targets
         3> Feature matrix shape
         4> How many students are 0 vs 1
## DAY 4 :- 
         1> Built a regression model to predict student final scores
         2> Built a classification model to determine career readiness
         3> Used train-test split for honest evaluation
         4> Evaluated regression using MSE and classification using Accuracy
         5> Successfully created an end-to-end ML pipeline
