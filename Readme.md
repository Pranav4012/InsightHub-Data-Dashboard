## DAY1 :-
         1> Set up the complete project structure
         2> Loaded and inspected the real student dataset
         3> Analyzed columns, data types, and missing values 
## DAY2 :- 
         1> Relationship between Attendance vs FinalScore
         2> Relationship between PracticeTime vs FinalScore
         3> Relationship between StudyHours vs FinalScore
         4> By the graph we analyze that the graph tends to upwards      
         5> Concluded that Attendance and PracticeTime have a strong influence on student performance
## DAY 3 :-
         1> Creates CareerReady based on FinalScore
         2> Separates features and targets
         3> Feature matrix shape
         4> How many students are 0 vs 1
## DAY 4 :- 
         1> Built a regression model to predict student final scores
         2> Built a classification model to determine career readiness
         3> Used train-test split for honest evaluation
         4> Evaluated regression using MSE and classification using Accuracy
         5> Successfully created an end-to-end ML pipeline
## DAY 5 :-
         1> extracted model coefficients
         2> mapped each feature to its influence
         3> identified which factors improve or reduce performance
         4> learned that ML models can be interpreted, not just used as black boxes         
## DAY 6 :-
         1> Trained a Linear Regression model to predict `FinalScore`
         2> Tested the model on unseen student data
         3> Compared: 
             .Actual FinalScore  
             .Predicted FinalScore 
         4> Calculated the **error** for each student
## DAY 7 :-
         1> Designing the prediction logic for the app
         2> Creating a reusable function for inference
         3> Separating “model training” from “user prediction”
         4> Why this step is essential before building the dashboard 
## DAY 8 :-
         1> Created a Streamlit app.py
         2> Loaded and trained:
            - Linear Regression model (FinalScore prediction)
            - Logistic Regression model (CareerReady classification)
         3>Built a UI that lets users:
             - Enter Study Hours
             - Attendance
             - Internal Marks
             - Practice Time
             - Backlogs
## DAY 9 :-
         1> Improving UI and clarity
         2> Making the dashboard user-friendly
         3> Shifting focus from “working” to “presentable”
         4> Learning to think like a product builder
